Earlier we discussed how to write to a file using FileOutputStream. 
In this tutorial we will see how to write to a file using BufferedWriter. 
We will be using write() method of BufferedWriter to write the text into a file. 
The advantage of using BufferedWriter is that it writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters 
so as to provide for the efficient writing (better performance) of single characters, arrays, and strings.
